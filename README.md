# Predicting the price of skincare products using linear regression
## Motivation
The beauty industry is a multibillion-dollar industry that is continuously growing since 2012 and is estimated to be $189.3 billion by 2025 (source: Statista.com). More people are beginning to use skincare at a younger age, and with so many products on the market, how could one decide what to buy based on their budget? By modeling the price of skincare products with various product features, business can understand what customers are valuing in an item. 

## Goal
In this project, the price of skincare products will be predicted using a linear regression model.  

## Data description
Over 1000 products features will be obtained by web scraping. 

## Tools
* Web scraping: BeautifulSoup and Selenium
* Linear regression: Python
* Modeling: Sklearn
* Visualizations: Pandas and matplotlib
